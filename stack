//major questions
// 1-4 have the same concept and using this concept we will solve problems till 7
1.Nearest Greater to left
2. Nearest Greater to right
3. Nearest smaller to left
4. Nearest smaller to right
5.stock span problem
6.minimum area of hist ogram
7. max area of rectangle in binary matrix
// conceptual problem
8. rain water trapping 
9. implementing a min stack
10.implementing stack using heap
11. the celebrity problem
12. longest valid parantheis
14. Iterative TOH
  
  //identification of stack questions
 1. mainly in case of array
 2. when the 2nd loop is dependent on the first loop then by using stack we can reduce time complexity
